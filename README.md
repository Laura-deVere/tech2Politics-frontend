The problem: Our challenge is finding a way that tech can encourage more women to run for office.

Possible Solution: 
Our team has come up with a solution that can begin to bridge the gap of promoting more women to run for office by creating a woman-centric platform that would focus on matchmaking potential local woman lawmakers (in their respective state) with tech women experts who would act as a consultant/advisor to support them.
